    <p>Hello! My name is Savin Raul-Calin, I`m 36y old currently living in MD.
    At the end of 2017 I wrote the first Hello World, and since then I have been learning to code, using diffrent sources of information and dedicating every minute of my spare time for this passion.</p>
    <p>As a person I`m communicative and friendly. Over the years, the jobs i performed always involved being in contact with people and being part of the team.</p>
    <p>I`m a dedicated self learner and problem solver. Programming has challenged me a lot, but hard work, curiosity and persistence helped me evolve.</p>
